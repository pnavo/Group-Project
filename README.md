# Group-Project
UCB Coding Bootcamp

This group project, performed in the summer of 2017, was to create a web application.

Our application allows users to enter geographic location information (i.e. city / state) and using the Google Maps API, searches for nearby locations where a pickup basketball game can be arranged. In addition to showing the nearby court locations, our app also allows for users to schedule games at courts to coordinate with other users, increasing participation.
